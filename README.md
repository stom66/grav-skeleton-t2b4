This is the T2B4 Grav skeleton. It includes a Grav installation pre-configured with the relevant pages and the T2B4 theme. See the [grav-t2b4](https://github.com/stom66/grav-t2b4) repository for more information on using the theme itself.

# Installation

To get started with the skeleton simply clone this directory, including its sub-modules:

`git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/stom66/grav-t2b4-skeleton.git`

# Features

* Mobile-first, Responsive Layout
* Numerous customizable options through admin interface
* 25 Predefined Bootswatch themes

## Basic Setup for a new Grav site

The simplest way to install T2B4 theme for Grav is to download and install the T2B4 Skeleton package:

1. [Download T2B4 Skeleton](http://getgrav.org/downloads/skeletons#extras)
2. Simply unzip the package into your web root folder.
3. Point your browser at the folder, job done!

**TIP:** Check out the [general Grav installation instructions](http://learn.getgrav.org/basics/installation) for more details on this process.

## Existing Grav site

It is possible to install just the theme, but page content will need to reference the [TwentyFifteen theme](https://github.com/getgrav/grav-theme-twentyfifteen)'s supported templates.  It is strongly advised to at least install the TwentyFifteen Skeleton package to see the theme's capabilities in action.

To install  **just** the theme:

```
$ bin/gpm install twentyfifteen
```
