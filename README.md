# Installation for a new site

As this theme is under development the only way to install it is to manually replace the `user` folder of a default Grav install with this repository.

* Clone the main grav repostiory
* Replace the `user` folder with this skeleton repostitory
* Run `bin/grav install`

You can do this from the command line as follows:

```
git clone -b master https://github.com/getgrav/grav.git public_html
rm -rf public_html/user
git clone https://github.com/stom66/grav-skeleton-t2b5 public_html/user
cd public_html
