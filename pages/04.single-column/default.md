We could cause a diplomatic crisis. Take the ship into the Neutral Zone Sure. You'd be surprised how far a hug goes with Geordi, or Worf. Why don't we just give everybody a promotion and call it a night - 'Commander'? Shields up! Rrrrred alert! Yes, absolutely, I do indeed concur, wholeheartedly! Fear is the true enemy, the only enemy. I guess it's better to be lucky than good.

What's a knock-out like you doing in a computer-generated gin joint like this? Well, I'll say this for him - he's sure of himself. Now we know what they mean by 'advanced' tactical training. I'm afraid I still don't understand, sir. Not if I weaken first.
