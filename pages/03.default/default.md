C'mon, he's not that bad. At least he's letting you borrow the car tomorrow night. Mayor Goldie Wilson, I like the sound of that. George. Remember, fellas, the future is in your hands. If you believe in progress, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas, progress is his middle name. 

Mayor Red Thomas's progress platform means more jobs, better education, bigger civic improvements, and lower taxes. On election day, cast your vote for a proven leader, re-elect Mayor Red Thomas...

I'm too loud. I can't believe it. I'm never gonna get a chance to play in front of anybody. George. Hello. Marty you gotta come back with me. Right, I got it.
